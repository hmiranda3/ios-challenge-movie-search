//In the movie controller, we will create a place where the NetworkController will deposit JSON data. The network controller will then fetch it, unwrap it, serialize the array of dictionaries, and convert it into an array of things we can use. It will then test all properties against the Movie model to see if we indeed have a movie in the form we want to display to the user.
