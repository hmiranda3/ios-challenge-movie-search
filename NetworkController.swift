//The NetworkController will be responsible for building URLs and executing HTTP Requests. It should have a method to return NSData from a URL:
import Foundation

// Here we created an enum that will be used in our perform request for URL function. This contains all of the possible HTTP requests that we can perform on an API. We may not use them all, but that's ok!
class NetworkController {
    enum HTTPMethod: String {
        case Get = "GET"
        case Put = "PUT"
        case Post = "POST"
        case Patch = "PATCH"
        case Delete = "DELETE"
    }
    
    //This function is used for accessing and pulling things from the network. An NSURL object represents a URL that can potentially contain the location of a resource on a remote server, the path of a local file on disk, or even an arbitrary piece of encoded data. Data objects let simple allocated buffers (that is, data with no embedded pointers) take on the behavior of Foundation objects; in other words it converts data into something we can use. Completion is included so that you know when the request is complete.
    static func performRequestForURL(url: NSURL, httpMethod: HTTPMethod, urlParameters: [String:String]? = nil, body: NSData? = nil, completion: ((data: NSData?, error: NSError?) -> Void)?) {
        
        //Here we create a requestURL that accesses the url and urlParameters parameters from the function above. This method will make the network call and call the completion closer with the NSData? result.
        let requestURL = urlFromURLParameters(url, urlParameters: urlParameters)
        let request = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: requestURL)
        request.HTTPMethod = httpMethod.rawValue
        request.HTTPBody = body
        
        let session = NSURLSession.sharedSession()
        let dataTask = session.dataTaskWithRequest(request) { (data, response, error) in
            if let completion = completion {
                completion(data: data, error: error)
            }
        }
        dataTask.resume()
    }
